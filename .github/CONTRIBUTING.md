## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

### Coding Style

* 2 spaces for indentation
* Use semicolons
* Use meaningful variable and function names
* Keep functions small and focused
* Follow the TypeScript best practices

## Issue Reporting

### Security Issues

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email security@duckshotssnapalytics.com instead.

### Bug Reports

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

1. What version of the project are you using?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

### Feature Requests

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in DuckShots SnapAlytics, you are probably not alone. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.
